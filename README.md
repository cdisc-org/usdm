# CDISC / Transcelerate DDF USDM Package

This package provides an implementation of the Digital Data Flow (DDF) CDISC / TransCelerate Unified Study Definitions Model (USDM). Two main parts are provided:

- Within the `usdm_model` directory are a set of classes reflecting the USDM model as transported using the DDF USDM API 
- Within the `usdm_excel` directory is a class, `USDMExcel`, that can be used to import an entire study definition from an excel file and build the equivalent json as defined by the API

# Warning

This package was, originally, not intended for public use and, consequently, only informal testing has been performed on the package to date. Formal testing has just begun. Use this at your own risk.

# Setup

Setup is via pip

`pip install usdm`

The package requires a single environment variable `CDISC_API_KEY` that should be set to your CDISC library API key. This is used to access CDISC CT and BC definitions in the CDISC library.

See below for a simple example program.

# USDM Model

Not further information as yet.

# Excel Import

## Example Program

The following code imports an Excel file (in the appropriate structure) and processes it. The data are then exported to a file in JSON API format. *Note: The logging is not needed.*

```
import logging
log = logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

import json
from usdm_excel import USDMExcel

excel = USDMExcel("source_data/simple_1.xlsx")
with open('source_data/simple_1.json', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
  f.write(json.dumps(json.loads(excel.to_json()), indent=2))
```

## Format of Workbook

### Example

An example spreadsheet in maintained within the [document directory](https://github.com/data4knowledge/usdm/tree/main/docs).

### Sheets

The workbook consists of several sheets each with a dedicated purpose. All sheets must be present except for those marked optional.

- Study sheet
- Study Identifiers sheet
- Study Amendments shhet
- Study Design sheet
- One or more Timeline sheets
- Study Design Activities sheet (optional)
- Study Design Indications sheet
- Study Design Interventions sheet
- Study Design Populations sheet
- Study Design Objectives and Endpoints sheet
- Study Design Eligibility Criteria sheet
- Study Design Estimands sheet
- Study Design Procedures sheet
- Study Design Encounters sheet
- Study Design Elements sheet
- Study Design Content sheet
- Dictionaries Sheet
- Configuration sheet

The content of each sheet is described below. 

### CDISC Terminology

For those cells where CDISC codes are used the user can enter either the CDISC C Code, for example `C15602`, the CDISC submission value, for example `PHASE III TRIAL`, or the preferred term, for example `Phase III Trial`

### Multiple Values

Some cells allow for multiple values. These are all comma separated. If users wish to include a comma within such strings then the string can be enclosed in quotes. For example `123, "123,456", 789`.

### External Terminology

For those cells where external CT is referenced the user can enter code in the form `<code system>: <code> = <decode>`. For example `SPONSOR: A = decode 1, SPONSOR: B = decode 2`. Where multiple codes are needed then the values are separated by commas.

### Boolean Values

For boolean fields the following can be used to indicate a `true` value `'Y', 'YES', 'T', 'TRUE', '1'` or the lower case equivalents.

### Identifiers and Cross References

Some content defined within the sheets contain unique identifiers such that the content can be cross referenced in other sheets. This is done so as to link content or expand definitions. Identifiers are simple strings that need to be unique within the workbook. There is a single definition and one or more cross references.

See the [infographic](https://github.com/data4knowledge/usdm/blob/main/docs/sheets.png) for further information.

### Timing Values

A number of fields specify timing values, either single relative values or ranges. These can be entered as
a *Timing Value* of ```<value> <unit>``` or a *Timing Range* of ```<lower>..<upper> <unit>```. The unit can be entered as follows:

- Years: 'Y', 'YRS', 'YR', 'YEARS', 'YEAR'
- Months: 'MTHS', 'MTH', 'MONTHS', 'MONTH'
- Weeks: 'W', 'WKS', 'WK', 'WEEKS', 'WEEK'
- Days: 'D', 'DYS', 'DY', 'DAYS', 'DAY'
- Hours: 'H', 'HRS', 'HR', 'HOURS', 'HOUR'
- Minutes: 'M', 'MINS', 'MIN', 'MINUTES', 'MINUTE'
- Seconds: 'S', 'SECS', 'SEC', 'SECONDS', 'SECOND'

So ```3 Y```, ```3 YRS```, ```3 YR```, ```3 YEARS```, ```3 YEAR``` are all equivalent. Only a single value and unit should be entered, i.e. combination values are not supported.

### Templated Text

Some entries can include "tags" that allow the text to reference structured content from elsewhere in the model. An example is an activity name. These sections of text are formatted as `[tag_name]` within the text. The `tag_name` refers to an entry within a dictionary (see the dictionaries sheet)

An example of Templated Text is `Subjects shall be between [min_age] and [max_age]` where the min and max ages will be inserted using the dictionary entries that refer to particular attribute values from within the structured parts of the model.

### Sheet Descriptions

The sheet descriptions detail the fields found within each sheet and the details of the data required. Note:

- Some fields have multiple names due to model changes and a desire to preserve backwards compatibility. Any of the choices documented can be used. 
- Some columns are optional and thus can be included or omitted. Again this is to preserve backwards compatibility. A default value is specified if the column is not included.

##### Timing

The timing seciton consists of multiple columns starting in column D. As many columns as needed can be created. A title block is held in Column C. The section consists of eight rows in rows 1 to 8 as follows:

| Row | Row Name | Purpose | Format and Values |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Epoch | The name of the epoch within which the timepoint falls. Note the cells in this row can be merged to link an epoch with many timepoints | Text string  |
| 2 | Cycle | The cycle in which the "timepoint" exists. Can be empty or set to '-' (empty) | Text string |
| 3 | First Cycle Start | The time at which the cycle starts. Should be specified. Empty if not part of a cycle | Text string |
| 4 | Cycle Period | The cycle period. Shoudl be specified. Empty if not part of a cycle | Text string |

<entry> ::= <type> [<count>] : [<relative timing>]
<type> ::= N | P| A | C
<count> ::= any positive integer (will default to 1)
<relative timing> ::= A single Timing Value
```
N = Next, P = Previous, A = Anchor and C = Cycle Start. The count when used with N or P indicates a relative to the Nth next or previous timepoint. When not specificed it defaults to 1.

`P2: +14 Days` indicates the timepoiint is relative to the 2nd previous timepoint by 14 days. A plus or minus sign can be entered but will be ignored as times are absolute.
`N1: 1 Day` is equivalent to `N: 1 Day` and indicates the timepoiint is relative to the next timepoint by 1 day.
`A:` is an anchor
