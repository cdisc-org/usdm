# CDISC / Transcelerate DDF USDM Package

This package provides an implementation of the Digital Data Flow (DDF) CDISC / TransCelerate Unified Study Definitions Model (USDM). Two main parts are provided:

- Within the `usdm_model` directory are a set of classes reflecting the USDM model as transported using the DDF USDM API 
- Within the `usdm_excel` directory is a class, `USDMExcel`, that can be used to import an entire study definition from an excel file and build the equivalent json as defined by the API

# Warning

This package was, originally, not intended for public use and, consequently, only informal testing has been performed on the package to date. Formal testing has just begun. Use this at your own risk.

# Setup

Setup is via pip

`pip install usdm`

The package requires a single environment variable `CDISC_API_KEY` that should be set to your CDISC library API key. This is used to access CDISC CT and BC definitions in the CDISC library.

See below for a simple example program.

# USDM Model

Not further information as yet.

# Excel Import

## Example Program

The following code imports an Excel file (in the appropriate structure) and processes it. The data are then exported to a file in JSON API format. *Note: The logging is not needed.*

```
import logging
log = logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

import json
from usdm_excel import USDMExcel

excel = USDMExcel("source_data/simple_1.xlsx")
with open('source_data/simple_1.json', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
  f.write(json.dumps(json.loads(excel.to_json()), indent=2))
```

## Format of Workbook

### Sheets

The workbook consists of several sheets each with a dedicated purpose. All sheets must be present except for those marked optional.

- Study sheet
- Study Identifiers sheet
- Study Design sheet
- one or more Timeline sheets
- Study Design Activities sheet (optional)
- Study Design Indications and Interventions sheet
- Study Design Populations sheet
- Study Design Objectives and Endpoints sheet
- Study Design Estimands sheet
- Study Design Procedures sheet
- Study Design Encounters sheet
- Study Design Elements sheet
- Configuration sheet

The content of each sheet is described below. Example workbooks can be found in the [CDISC Reference Architecture repo](https://github.com/cdisc-org/DDF-RA/tree/sprint-11/Deliverables/IG/examples). *Note: the link above points to the sprint 11 branch. This will be merged into the main branch prior to public review.*

### CDISC Terminology

For those cells where CDISC codes are used the user can enter either the CDISC C Code, for example `C15602`, the CDISC submission value, for example `PHASE III TRIAL`, or the preferred term, for example `Phase III Trial`

### Multiple Values

Some cells allow for multiple values. These are all comma separated. If users wish to include a comma within such strings then the string can be enclosed in quotes. For example `123, "123,456", 789`.

### External Terminology

For those cells where external CT is referenced the user can enter code in the form `<code system>: <code> = <decode>`. For example `SPONSOR: A = decode 1, SPONSOR: B = decode 2`. Where multiple codes are needed then the values are separated by commas.

### Boolean Values

For boolean fields the following can be used to indicate a `true` value `'Y', 'YES', 'T', 'TRUE', '1'` or the lower case equivalents.

### Identifiers and Cross References

Some content defined within the sheets contain unique identifiers such that the content can be cross referenced in other sheets. This is done so as to link content or expand definitions. Identifiers are simple strings that need to be unique within the workbook. There is a single definition and one or more cross references.

See the [infographic](https://github.com/data4knowledge/usdm/blob/main/docs/sheets.png) for further information.

### Timeline sheets

#### Sheet Name

As defined within the study design sheet, see above.

#### Sheet Contents

##### General

This is a complicated sheet. It is, in essence, an enhanced SoA. There are several sections within the sheet:

- The name, description and condition located top right
- The remainder of the sheet is the SoA with:
  - The timing set in the top rows, the "timepoints"
  - The activities down the left hand side
  - The link between activities and "timepoints", the classic 'X'

##### Name, Description, Condition

The name description and condition are located in columns A and B, rows 1 and 2. It is a vertical name value pair configuration

| Row | Row Name | Description | Format and Values |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Name | The timeline name | Text string |
| 2 | Description | Timeline description | Text string |
| 3 | Condition | Timeline entry condition | Text string |

##### Timing

The timing seciton consists of multiple columns starting in column D. As many columns as needed can be created. A title block is held in Column C. The section consists of eight rows in rows 1 to 8 as follows:

| Row | Row Name | Description | Format and Values |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Epoch | The name of the epoch within which the timepoint falls. Note the cells in this row can be merged to link an epoch with many timepoints | Text string  |
| 2 | Cycle | The cycle in which the "timepoint" exists. Can be empty or set to '-' (empty) | Text string |
| 3 | First Cycle Start | The time at which the cycle starts. Should be specified. Empty if not part of a cycle | Text string |
| 4 | Cycle Period | The cycle period. Shoudl be specified. Empty if not part of a cycle | Text string |
| 5 | Cycle End Rule | The cycle end rule. Can be empty. Empty if not part of a cycle | Text string |
| 6 | Timing | "Timepoint" timing.  | Text String |
| 7 | Encounter xref | Cross reference tot he encounter in which the timepoint belongs. Can be empty | Text string |
| 8 | Window | Timing window. Can be empty | Text string |

The timepont timing takes the form defined as follows (using pseudo BNF). 

```
<entry> ::= <type> [<count>] : [<relative timing>]
<type> ::= N | P| A | C
<count> ::= any positive integer (will default to 1)
<relative timing> ::= string
```
N = Next, P = Previous, A = Anchor and C = Cycle Start. The count when used with N or P indicates a relative to the Nth next or previous timepoint. When not specificed it defaults to 1.

`P2: +14 Days` indicates the timepoiint is relative to the 2nd previous timepoint by 14 days.
`N1: 1 Day` is equivalent to `N: 1 Day` and indicates the timepoiint is relative to the next timepoint by 1 day.
`A:` is an anchor

##### Activity

The activity section consists of three columns, A to C, starting in row 10, row 9 being a title row. As many rows as needed can be added.

| Column | Column Name | Description | Format and Values |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| A | Parent Activity | Parent Activity. Not used currently | Set to '-' |
| B | Child Activity | Child activity name | Text string |
| C | BC/Procedure/Timeline | A set of BCs, procedures or timelines. Comma separated or the form detailed below | :--- |

The BC, procedure, timeline format is defined as follows (using pseudo BNF):

```
<entries> ::= <entry> | <entries> <entry>
<entry> ::= <type> : <name> | empty
<type> ::= PR | BC | TL
<name> ::= <name of item>
```

`BC: Age, BC: Sec, PR:Informed Consent Form, TL:Exercise` indicates the activity consists of the bcs Age and Sex, a procedure for the informed consent and a timeline specified in the Exercise sheet.

##### Link

The link section consists of a set of cells into which an upper case 'X' can be placed to link a timepoint with an activity. Otherwise the cell will be ignored. A '-' can be used to fill in cells but "empty".
