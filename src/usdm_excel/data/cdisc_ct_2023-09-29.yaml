      the metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the drug in humans, the side effects
      associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on
      effectiveness. During Phase 1, sufficient information about the drug''s pharmacokinetics

      included in Phase I studies varies with the drug, but is generally in the range
      of 20 to 80. Phase 1 studies also include studies of drug metabolism, structure-activity
